      <description>Code
DesignThe purpose of this prototype was to incorporate controls that extended beyond the traditional human-computer interaction in game design.
To achieve this, I chose to use off-the-shelf hardware to track a user&amp;rsquo;s heartbeat, which in turn controls the ship they are on.
SoftwareThe game polls the heart rate monitor at a rate of 3 hz. At game start, I &amp;ldquo;calibrate&amp;rdquo; the sensor by taking the heart rate and computing a moving average across a range of 30 seconds.</description>
