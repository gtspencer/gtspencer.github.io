      <description>Code
Design    Flying blind is an experimental VR game where controls are confided to the heart. Put simply, raise your heartrate to go up, lower your heart rate to go down.
The purpose of this prototype was to incorporate controls that extended beyond the traditional human-computer interaction in game design.
To achieve this, I chose to use off-the-shelf hardware to track a user&amp;rsquo;s heartbeat, which in turn controls the ship they are on.</description>
