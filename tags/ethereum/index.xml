      <description>Over the past few months, I have done a deep dive in to Solidity and Ethereum development. This has included some Web3, but the main focus has been on Solidity and ERC standards. Below is a short list of resources I used, as well as some brief takeaways.
Resources I UsedNader Dabit. I cannot stress enough how phenomenal that guy is at teaching.
