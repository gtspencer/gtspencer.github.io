      <title>The Function of Supply: An ERC-20 Experiment in Minimum Transactable Value</title>

      <description>An Experiment in the Supply of ERC-20 TokensThis is still a work in progress
AbstractThis &amp;ldquo;greypaper&amp;rdquo; serves to identify a little discussed issue. Popular tokens like Ethereum and Bitcoin, as they gain popularity, inch closer to a divisibility bomb in what I&amp;rsquo;ve dubbed &amp;ldquo;the Satoshi problem.&amp;rdquo; High market cap coins with limited supply and fixed divisibility will eventually experience a slowdown in the network when users are unable to micro-transact.</description>

      <title>Past Project Spotlight #1: Flying Blind, a heart-beat sensing game</title>

      <description>Code
DesignThe purpose of this prototype was to incorporate controls that extended beyond the traditional human-computer interaction in game design.
To achieve this, I chose to use off-the-shelf hardware to track a user&amp;rsquo;s heartbeat, which in turn controls the ship they are on.
SoftwareThe game polls the heart rate monitor at a rate of 3 hz. At game start, I &amp;ldquo;calibrate&amp;rdquo; the sensor by taking the heart rate and computing a moving average across a range of 30 seconds.</description>
