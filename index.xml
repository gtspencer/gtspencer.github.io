      <description>And thus begins my first weekly. A major point of this is exercise is to keep engaged and up to date with both current events and current media. I often find myself wishing I had kept more up-to-date with certain happenings, and this is my chance to mitigate any of that in the future. With that being said, let&amp;rsquo;s dive in to this week&amp;rsquo;s Threekly:
 A thought problem I&amp;rsquo;ve been consumed with:  Russell&amp;rsquo;s ParadoxThis video does a great job explaining it, but I will do my best here.</description>

      <description>Spencer Obsitnik (born Speezy F Baby, November 17, 1995) is an Oscar nominated child of four. After inventing Facebook, he rode 1000 miles on camelback to diffuse forgotten landmines. An Ashkenazi Jew by trade, and an Olympic surfer by birthright, he now lays dormant on his vast collections of oxford commas, beanie babies, and Cheerio&amp;rsquo;s Year 2000 pennies, where he wishes to be disturbed only by the Obamas.
You may say I&amp;rsquo;m a dreamer, but I&amp;rsquo;m not.</description>
